After scanning the QRCode in the Vaccination certificate we get:

After converting the base64 string to raw data we get:

After rotaing the character by 4 values after according to the order in alphabet we get:

After decoding the next line using playfair cipher algorithm we get:
RSAENCRYPTNUMBERTWOHUNDREDFOURTYTHREEWITHNVALUEASTWOTHOUSANDFOURHUNDREDANDNINETEENANDEVALUEASELEVENX

Which says: RSA ENCRYPT NUMBER TWO HUNDRED FOURTY THREE WITH N VALUE AS TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETEEN AND E VALUE AS ELEVEN X

After RSA encrypting the number 243 with n = 2419 and e = 11 we get:
(243^(11))%2419 = 1982

The pin to open the zipped file : 1982

After opening the zip file we have the text (from the textfile inside the zip): 
TM, DTZ KTZSI RJðŸ˜”. HTSLWFYX. YMNX NX YMJ JSILTFQ. TW NX NY?ðŸ¤¨

After rotating the character by 21 values according to the order in alphabet we get:
OH, YOU FOUND MEðŸ˜”. CONGRATS. THIS IS THE ENDGOAL. OR IS IT?ðŸ¤¨


<--- The final message = OH, YOU FOUND MEðŸ˜”. CONGRATS. THIS IS THE ENDGOAL. OR IS IT?ðŸ¤¨ ---->
